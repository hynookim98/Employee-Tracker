# Employee-Tracker

## Description
Hello my name is Matthew Kim and I am a beginner programmer studying at the UCI Coding Bootcamp. This program was created to keep track of a group of employees in a company organized by managers, departments, roles, and etc. The program works all inside the terminal and lets the user interact with the data in a way where they can view, add, edit, or delete information on each employee. 
Here is a video showing the functionality of the program:

Here is a screenshot of the functioning program.
